    <h1>Welcome to the Run with the Pack 5k!</h1>
    <p> Welcome to the Run with the Pck 5k hosted by the NC State Cross Country and Track Club!
        The first annual Run With the Pack 5k takes place at WakeMed Park in Cary, NC on September 23rd, 2017. 
        Well known for its college and high school invitationals, this course provides a great opportunity for 
       community members and club runners alike to compete for a fast time. The course contains
         one and a half loops around the park on their USATF certified course. There is one major hill 
         on the course that is run around the mile 1 and 3 points. The end of the race is uphill but 
         levels out for the home stretch. Packet pickup will happen the morning of the race starting at 7:00.
		
		This event is unique that not only will their be awards for age group winners but we will also have 
		an award for runners who come closest to a "secret" finishing time. Additionally after the community 
		race their will also be a collegiate club race showcasing student talent from both the triangle
		 area and the larger Southeast region for runners to stay and watch.
		 We look forward to seeing you out there!</p>
